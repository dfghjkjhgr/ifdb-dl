# ifdb-dl

Download games from IFDB onto your Kindle with ease!  Inspired by
KindleFetch.  Meant to be used in conjunction with Gargoyle IF
interpreter for Kindle.

## Download

Obviously you need to jailbreak your kindle first before using this.
Kterm is also a requirement.  In any case, use ./make-release.sh to generate the latest release or use a
pre-built one.  Unzip the file and drag to /mnt/us/extensions on your
Kindle. Enjoy!

# TODO
